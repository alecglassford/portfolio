# Alec Glassford
![slightly silly photo of Alec Glassford wearing a fox scarf](assets/me.jpg)

I'm a student + technologist + journalist + human. This site is (very much) a work in progress. In the meantime, you'll find more details about me at the links below.

## Me, elsewhere
* [Keybase](https://keybase.io/alecglassford) - Send me an encrypted message, or see that other accounts are verifiably linked to this identity.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alecglassford) - Although I've been on the site since middle school (!), I don't tweet very often. My DMs are open.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/alecglassford) - Some code I've written is here! Some I've written (especially for class or work) is not.
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alecglassford) - This communicates my educational and work experiences pretty effectively. My [resume](assets/alec-glassford-resume-2017-03-01.pdf) sums up much of it too.
* [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/alec/) - Really trying to get on that FOIA Friday grind!

## [My own damn house üè°](https://psmag.com/social-justice/toast-story-latest-artisanal-food-craze-72676)
* [read](https://read.alec.casa) - I've been trying to keep track of what I read online, and you are welcome to take a peek. The technical setup here is lots of fun too: bookmarklets, [a teesny Glitch server](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/alec-reads), using D3 for templating, etc. I'll write more about this in the future.
* [blog](https://blog.alec.casa) - There is a blog here. It's pretty empty.
* [vere](https://vere.alec.casa) - A tiny podcast diary I made to (sort of) document the end of college.
* [roar](https://roar.alec.casa) - ? ü¶Å ? üåä ?

## Things I've worked on

What appears here is definitely not comprehensive.

### Ongoing

* [ProPublica](https://propublica.org) - I'm a news applications fellow at this nonprofit newsroom for summer 2017, working mainly on [Nonprofit Explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits), a web application that helps you research nonprofit organizations in the United Staates.

* [The Stanford Storytelling Project](https://storytelling.stanford.edu) - I maintain the website and do other technical tasks (e.g. organize audio and build the podcast feed) for this truly incredible group that works with storytelling in many forms. I do a bit of radio production too.

### Projects
In roughly reverse chronological order.

* [Call Collect](https://hackdash.org/projects/5918b5994545fa01a8db176c) - At the wonderful [Come and Play](http://comeandplay.org/) audio hackathon, my team made this tool that helps radio/podcast producers source audio from their listeners: it's a super simple interface for building custom hotlines with the Twilio API. Not usable right now, but look out for something soon ‚Ä¶
* [Toast and Tea](https://github.com/alecglassford/facebook-poetry) ‚Äî A project I worked on with friends at [Codex Hackathon 2017](http://codexhackathon.com/): It's a Chrome extension that inserts poetry into your Facebook news feed.
* [New Yorker Department Browser](https://alecglassford.github.io/new-yorker-sections/) ‚Äî Another project I worked on at [Codex Hackathon 2017](http://codexhackathon.com/): Mainly, I scraped a dataset of all *New Yorker* magazine articles from the last 10 years or so with their authors and "departments" (which are the funnest thing in the world, because, you know, they usually aren't real departments as most of us think of the term). And then I made this pretty unsatisfying visualization, which I hope to improve when I have some time. I'd also love to combine gender analysis of author names (see below) to see who writes for which departments.
* [Breaking News Consumer Handbook Bot](http://bnch.glitch.me/) - Inspired by [On the Media](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/otm/) and [Paul Ford](https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/754046492177010688), I made a little Twitter bot that tweets out the invaluable [Breaking News Consumer's Handbooks](https://www.wnyc.org/series/breaking-news-consumers-handbook/). Most of the effort was data wrangling, and it doesn't work super robustly since it's deployed on Glitch, which is a gorgeous, fun platform that I was delighted to play with but is not particularly suited to production (the bot sleeps a lot). Maybe I'll redeploy it somewhere more appropriate at some point. But yay for media literacy!
* [Patterns in the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for Fiction and Poetry](https://alecglassford.github.io/literary-prizes/) - A wee visualization comparing nominees and winners of these prizes.
* [Visualizing Literary Influence in the Paris Review Interviews](https://stanford.edu/~gla/paris/) - A visualization tool for exploring the connections between some of modernity's greatest makers of literature. Check out [the accompanying paper](assets/visualizing-paris-review.pdf) I wrote too.
* [Too Many Slacks](https://github.com/alecglassford/too-many-slacks) - A tool for making deep links to Slack teams for your iOS homescreen.
* [Scroll percentage widget](https://github.com/alecglassford/percent-scroll-widget) - A tiny Chrome extension I made for myself so I could see how far down a webpage I had scrolled. Is this really a good idea for my attention span/mental wellbeing? I don't know! But maybe I'll clean and package it up for the Chrome store at some point.
* ["Time Searcher"](https://alecglassford.github.io/time-searcher/) - My first major exploration with D3.js. I can't take any credit for the design here; the details of the class assignment this was built for are linked through from the app itself.
* [Bikopticon](https://bikopticon.surge.sh/) - A slightly rushed final project for my computational journalism class that allows you to explore bike counter data from around Seattle in a maybe not super user-friendly way. I loved working with the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net) API though‚Äîit's awesome! And using Surge and Frozen Flask too.
* [Detecting Deceptive Opinion Spam](assets/detecting-deceptive-opinion-spam.pdf) - Final research paper on a text classification project for my natural language understanding class.
* [King County food inspections](https://safe-dawn-87291.herokuapp.com/) - A tool to quickly browse restaurant inspections in the Seattle area, made for my computational journalism class.
* ["Automated Gender Analysis of New Yorker Bylines"](https://github.com/alecglassford/compciv-2016/blob/master/projects/gender-detector-data/README.md) - An analysis of the gender breakdown of bylines from *The New Yorker*, my final project for "Computational Methods in the Civic Sphere." Did some fun web scraping and plotting. I still want to expand on this to look at particular sections!
