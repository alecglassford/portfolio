<p><img src="assets/me.jpg" alt="slightly silly photo of Alec Glassford wearing a fox scarf"></p>
<p>I&#39;m a student + technologist + journalist + human. This site is (very much) a work in progress. In the meantime, you&#39;ll find more details about me at the links below.</p>
<h2 id="me-elsewhere">Me, elsewhere</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://keybase.io/alecglassford">Keybase</a> - Send me an encrypted message, or see that other accounts are verifiably linked to this identity.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alecglassford">Twitter</a> - Although I&#39;ve been on the site since middle school (!), I don&#39;t tweet very often. My DMs are open.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford">GitHub</a> - Some code I&#39;ve written is here! Some I&#39;ve written (especially for class or work) is not.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alecglassford">LinkedIn</a> - This communicates my educational and work experiences pretty effectively. My <a href="assets/alec-glassford-resume-2017-03-01.pdf">resume</a> sums up much of it too.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/alec/">MuckRock</a> - Really trying to get on that FOIA Friday grind!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-my-own-damn-house-https-psmag-com-social-justice-toast-story-latest-artisanal-food-craze-72676-"><a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/toast-story-latest-artisanal-food-craze-72676">My own damn house üè°</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://read.alec.casa">read</a> - I&#39;ve been trying to keep track of what I read online, and you are welcome to take a peek. The technical setup here is lots of fun too: bookmarklets, <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/alec-reads">a teesny Glitch server</a>, using D3 for templating, etc. I&#39;ll write more about this in the future.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alec.casa">blog</a> - There is a blog here. It&#39;s pretty empty.</li>
<li><a href="https://vere.alec.casa">vere</a> - A tiny podcast diary I made to (sort of) document the end of college.</li>
<li><a href="https://roar.alec.casa">roar</a> - ? ü¶Å ? üåä ?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-i-ve-worked-on">Things I&#39;ve worked on</h2>
<p>What appears here is definitely not comprehensive.</p>
<h3 id="ongoing">Ongoing</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a> - I&#39;m a news applications fellow at this nonprofit newsroom for summer 2017, working mainly on <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits">Nonprofit Explorer</a>, a web application that helps you research nonprofit organizations in the United Staates.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://storytelling.stanford.edu">The Stanford Storytelling Project</a> - I maintain the website and do other technical tasks (e.g. organize audio and build the podcast feed) for this truly incredible group that works with storytelling in many forms. I do a bit of radio production too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>In roughly reverse chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackdash.org/projects/5918b5994545fa01a8db176c">Call Collect</a> - At the wonderful <a href="http://comeandplay.org/">Come and Play</a> audio hackathon, my team made this tool that helps radio/podcast producers source audio from their listeners: it&#39;s a super simple interface for building custom hotlines with the Twilio API. Not usable right now, but look out for something soon ‚Ä¶</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/facebook-poetry">Toast and Tea</a> ‚Äî A project I worked on with friends at <a href="http://codexhackathon.com/">Codex Hackathon 2017</a>: It&#39;s a Chrome extension that inserts poetry into your Facebook news feed.</li>
<li><a href="https://alecglassford.github.io/new-yorker-sections/">New Yorker Department Browser</a> ‚Äî Another project I worked on at <a href="http://codexhackathon.com/">Codex Hackathon 2017</a>: Mainly, I scraped a dataset of all <em>New Yorker</em> magazine articles from the last 10 years or so with their authors and &quot;departments&quot; (which are the funnest thing in the world, because, you know, they usually aren&#39;t real departments as most of us think of the term). And then I made this pretty unsatisfying visualization, which I hope to improve when I have some time. I&#39;d also love to combine gender analysis of author names (see below) to see who writes for which departments.</li>
<li><a href="http://bnch.glitch.me/">Breaking News Consumer Handbook Bot</a> - Inspired by <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/otm/">On the Media</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/754046492177010688">Paul Ford</a>, I made a little Twitter bot that tweets out the invaluable <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/series/breaking-news-consumers-handbook/">Breaking News Consumer&#39;s Handbooks</a>. Most of the effort was data wrangling, and it doesn&#39;t work super robustly since it&#39;s deployed on Glitch, which is a gorgeous, fun platform that I was delighted to play with but is not particularly suited to production (the bot sleeps a lot). Maybe I&#39;ll redeploy it somewhere more appropriate at some point. But yay for media literacy!</li>
<li><a href="https://alecglassford.github.io/literary-prizes/">Patterns in the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for Fiction and Poetry</a> - A wee visualization comparing nominees and winners of these prizes.</li>
<li><a href="https://stanford.edu/~gla/paris/">Visualizing Literary Influence in the Paris Review Interviews</a> - A visualization tool for exploring the connections between some of modernity&#39;s greatest makers of literature. Check out <a href="assets/visualizing-paris-review.pdf">the accompanying paper</a> I wrote too.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/too-many-slacks">Too Many Slacks</a> - A tool for making deep links to Slack teams for your iOS homescreen.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/percent-scroll-widget">Scroll percentage widget</a> - A tiny Chrome extension I made for myself so I could see how far down a webpage I had scrolled. Is this really a good idea for my attention span/mental wellbeing? I don&#39;t know! But maybe I&#39;ll clean and package it up for the Chrome store at some point.</li>
<li><a href="https://alecglassford.github.io/time-searcher/">&quot;Time Searcher&quot;</a> - My first major exploration with D3.js. I can&#39;t take any credit for the design here; the details of the class assignment this was built for are linked through from the app itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://bikopticon.surge.sh/">Bikopticon</a> - A slightly rushed final project for my computational journalism class that allows you to explore bike counter data from around Seattle in a maybe not super user-friendly way. I loved working with the <a href="https://darksky.net">Dark Sky</a> API though‚Äîit&#39;s awesome! And using Surge and Frozen Flask too.</li>
<li><a href="assets/detecting-deceptive-opinion-spam.pdf">Detecting Deceptive Opinion Spam</a> - Final research paper on a text classification project for my natural language understanding class.</li>
<li><a href="https://safe-dawn-87291.herokuapp.com/">King County food inspections</a> - A tool to quickly browse restaurant inspections in the Seattle area, made for my computational journalism class.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/compciv-2016/blob/master/projects/gender-detector-data/README.md">&quot;Automated Gender Analysis of New Yorker Bylines&quot;</a> - An analysis of the gender breakdown of bylines from <em>The New Yorker</em>, my final project for &quot;Computational Methods in the Civic Sphere.&quot; Did some fun web scraping and plotting. I still want to expand on this to look at particular sections!</li>
