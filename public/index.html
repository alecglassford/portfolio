<p>Hi. I&#39;m a technologist + journalist + word/bird fan + human. You&#39;ll find some more details about me and stuff I&#39;ve worked on below, but of course you&#39;re not going to get a complete picture. Please feel free to just <a href="https://keybase.io/alecglassford">get in touch</a>!</p>
<h2 id="me-elsewhere">Me, elsewhere</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://keybase.io/alecglassford">Keybase</a> - Send me an encrypted message, or see that other accounts are verifiably linked to this identity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alecglassford">Twitter</a> - Although I&#39;ve been on the site since middle school (!), I don&#39;t tweet very often. My DMs are open.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford">GitHub</a> - Some code I&#39;ve written is here! Some I&#39;ve written (especially for class or work) is not.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alecglassford">LinkedIn</a> - <del>This communicates my educational and work experiences pretty effectively. My <a href="assets/alec-glassford-resume-2018-01-03.pdf">resume</a> sums up much of it too.</del> Okay, so my LinkedIn and resume are several months out of date. I&#39;ll update them soon, but I have been prioritizing other things. Also, I&#39;ve opted to spell &quot;resume&quot; without any accents, but I did use an i with two dots over it somewhere on this page, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/alec/">MuckRock</a> - Really trying to get on that FOIA Friday grind!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://read.alec.casa">read</a> - I&#39;ve been trying to keep track of what I read online, and you are welcome to take a peek. The technical setup here is lots of fun too: bookmarklets, <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/alec-reads">a teesny Glitch server</a>, using D3 for templating, etc. I&#39;ll write more about this in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://blog.alec.casa">blog</a> - There is a blog here. It&#39;s pretty empty.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://roar.alec.casa">roar</a> - ? ü¶Å ? üåä ?</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://ends.alec.casa">ends</a> - Pure silliness, feat. LCD Soundsystem. (I&#39;m not even that big of an LCD Soundsystem fan, and I&#39;m also not sure why I feel the need to provide that caveat.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://word.alec.casa">word</a> - Find words that match patterns (probably good for cheating on crosswords).</p>

<h2 id="things-i-ve-worked-on">Things I&#39;ve worked on</h2>
<p>What appears here is definitely not comprehensive. In roughly reverse chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span id="seattle-times">Projects at the Seattle Times</span> - I worked on various aspects of a numbers of stories as the interactives intern at the Seattle Times, including these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2018/summer-guide/">Build your own Seattle summer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2018/how-to-buy-a-home/">How to buy a home in the Seattle area: a survival guide</a></li>

<li><a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2018/love-hate-seattle">I hate you, Seattle: a love story</a></li>
</ul>
<p>‚Äîand a few others, some of which I&#39;ll add after they run. And also <a href="https://github.com/seattletimes/wpdown">this Chrome extension</a> to download Wordpress drafts as Markdown.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/call-collect">Call Collect</a> - A tool I built for my <a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/call-collect/blob/master/docs/THESIS.md">master&#39;s thesis</a> that helps journalists gather audio by making it easy for them to create call-in lines and web widgets where listeners can record their responses to prompts. This started as a <a href="https://hackdash.org/projects/5918b5994545fa01a8db176c">project</a> I built with an incredible team of radio producers and technologists at the wonderful <a href="https://comeandplay.org/">Come and Play</a> audio hackathon. I plan to revisit this project soon, but if you want to try it out, <a href="https://alecglassford.github.io/call-collect/">these interactive instructions</a> are pretty comprehensive. I&#39;d love your feedback.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@alecglassford/so-fetch">so fetch!</a> - A tiny module that proxies fetch requests through a Glitch server and na√Øvely adds CORS headers so you can easily load data into <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/">Observable</a> notebooks. I was surprised and excited when I made this, because I thought I might have been the first person to make a Mean Girls reference in relation to the JavaScript fetch API, but <a href="https://github.com/zkat/make-fetch-happen">I was wrong about that</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://twarc.glitch.me/">Twarc</a> - A super simple service anyone can use to archive a Twitter user&#39;s timeline in about 5 seconds (no code to write, no API key necessary, just enter a simple URL). Made in Glitch, and designed/documented for remixing. <a href="https://twitter.com/alecglassford/status/937108649222139904">I wrote a bit more on it here.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://peninsulapress.com/2017/11/17/palo-alto-evaluating-regulations-to-improve-safety-of-seismically-vulnerable-buildings/">Palo Alto evaluating regulations to improve safety of seismically vulnerable buildings</a> - I wrote about the risks some buildings in Palo Alto could face in an earthquake and some of the steps the city is considering taking to improve safety.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/">Nonprofit Explorer</a> - As a news application fellow during summer 2017, I made some significant updates to this news application, one of <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>&#39;s most popular. (It helps you research nonprofit organizations, primarily by making their Form 990 IRS filings easy to browse). I made millions of filings that the IRS had recently released in XML format accessible in the app (in the raw machine-readable format and also styled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> into more human-friendly versions). <a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/nonprofit-explorer-update-full-text-of-nearly-two-million-records">I wrote a blog post going into that work in some more detail.</a> I also added PDFs of audits for some organizations to the app, restyled it to better match ProPublica&#39;s more recent news applications, and did other maintenance. I learned a lot about Ruby and Rails! And got to practice writing SQL + doing data spot-checking and analysis with csvkit and other command line tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://projects.propublica.org/hate-news-index/">Documenting Hate News Index</a> - Did a small amount of work on this news application while I was at ProPublica (just a bit: you can see my name is really small at the bottom). Basically just maintaining it briefly and debugging some issues with the data pipeline; it was a good experience working with some bits of Google Cloud Platform and collaborating with Google News Lab.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dataisthenew">Data is the new</a> - I made this little Twitter bot that searches Twitter for &quot;data is the new _&quot; and it tells you how people are filling in that blank. &quot;Data is the new oil&quot; is popular, but I find &quot;data is the new asbestos&quot; a bit more interesting. <a href="https://glitch.com/~dataisthenew">Here&#39;s the code on Glitch, and more on the backstory.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Essays on Taylor Swift et al. - For a creative writing tutorial, I wrote a series of personal essays ostensibly about Taylor Swift, though they are also about a bunch of stuff that is not Taylor Swift. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è These are unpublished but I&#39;d like to revisit them, and if you&#39;d ever like to talk about them, I would probably be happy to.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/facebook-poetry">Toast and Tea</a> - A project I worked on with friends at <a href="http://codexhackathon.com/">Codex Hackathon 2017</a>: It&#39;s a Chrome extension that inserts poetry into your Facebook news feed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://alecglassford.github.io/new-yorker-sections/">New Yorker Department Browser</a> - Another project I worked on at <a href="http://codexhackathon.com/">Codex Hackathon 2017</a>: Mainly, I scraped a dataset of all <em>New Yorker</em> magazine articles from the last 10 years or so with their authors and &quot;departments&quot; (which are the funnest thing in the world, because, you know, they usually aren&#39;t real departments as most of us think of the term). And then I made this pretty unsatisfying visualization, which I hope to improve when I have some time. I&#39;d also love to combine gender analysis of author names (see below) to see who writes for which departments.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://bnch.glitch.me/">Breaking News Consumer Handbook Bot</a> - Inspired by <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/otm/">On the Media</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/754046492177010688">Paul Ford</a>, I made a little Twitter bot that tweets out the invaluable <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/series/breaking-news-consumers-handbook/">Breaking News Consumer&#39;s Handbooks</a>. Most of the effort was data wrangling, and it doesn&#39;t work super robustly since it&#39;s deployed on Glitch, which is a gorgeous, fun platform that I was delighted to play with but is not particularly suited to production (the bot sleeps a lot). Maybe I&#39;ll redeploy it somewhere more appropriate at some point. But yay for media literacy!</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://alecglassford.github.io/literary-prizes/">Patterns in the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for Fiction and Poetry</a> - A wee visualization comparing nominees and winners of these prizes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://stanford.edu/~gla/paris/">Visualizing Literary Influence in the Paris Review Interviews</a> - A visualization tool for exploring the connections between some of modernity&#39;s greatest makers of literature. Check out <a href="assets/visualizing-paris-review.pdf">the accompanying paper</a> I wrote too.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/too-many-slacks">Too Many Slacks</a> - A tool for making deep links to Slack teams for your iOS homescreen.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/percent-scroll-widget">Scroll percentage widget</a> - A tiny Chrome extension I made for myself so I could see how far down a webpage I had scrolled. Is this really a good idea for my attention span/mental wellbeing? I don&#39;t know! <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/percent-scroll-widget/cgchlengahipakmdkopgeheagmlcifep">It&#39;s in the Chrome Web Store though.</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://alecglassford.github.io/time-searcher/">&quot;Time Searcher&quot;</a> - My first major exploration with D3.js. I can&#39;t take any credit for the design here; the details of the class assignment this was built for are linked through from the app itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://bikopticon.surge.sh/">Bikopticon</a> - A slightly rushed final project for my computational journalism class that allows you to explore bike counter data from around Seattle in a maybe not super user-friendly way. I loved working with the <a href="https://darksky.net">Dark Sky</a> API though‚Äîit&#39;s awesome! And using Surge and Frozen Flask too.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="assets/detecting-deceptive-opinion-spam.pdf">Detecting Deceptive Opinion Spam</a> - Final research paper on a text classification project for my natural language understanding class.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://safe-dawn-87291.herokuapp.com/">King County food inspections</a> - A tool to quickly browse restaurant inspections in the Seattle area, made for my computational journalism class.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/alecglassford/compciv-2016/blob/master/projects/gender-detector-data/README.md">&quot;Automated Gender Analysis of New Yorker Bylines&quot;</a> - An analysis of the gender breakdown of bylines from <em>The New Yorker</em>, my final project for &quot;Computational Methods in the Civic Sphere.&quot; Did some fun web scraping and plotting. I still want to expand on this to look at particular sections!</p>
